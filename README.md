```bash
npm run dev

## About
This was a hobby project inspired by the Heroes and Villains album rollout by Metro Boomin. Using the promotional material, I created a Nextjs web app inspired by Tekken character-select screens. 

This project is currently hosted on [Netfliy](https://639e80f125537300097984dd--resonant-douhua-f2233f.netlify.app) for free. This *does* impact pefrormance, but it is a worthy trade-off for free hosting.
